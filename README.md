# Knulli on Anbernic RG-XX Devices

This is a living document that describes what I learned setting up and running Knulli on the [Anbernic RG35XX-H](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xx-h) and [Anbernic RG40XX-H](https://anbernic.com/products/rg40xx-h).

This file will most likely contain errors and vague information. \
You might not like how I describe things. I am sorry. \
Also, I can't be held responsible if you break stuff by following this. \
Nor will I share ROMS, BIOS, or any other files with you. Ask Google instead.

If you find this information helpful, please consider giving it a ⭐️ at GitHub. \
And maybe consider [buying me a ☕️](https://ko-fi.com/lennart0815).

Look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/LennartHennigs/RG35XX-H-Notes/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes to this document.

**Note**: This guide is standing on the shoulders of giants. Many of the tips here come from [beanioz on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RG35XX_Plus/comments/1b2zcyk/batocera_a_few_tips/) and other people on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RG35XX_H/).

## Introduction

- Knulli is a Linux-based custom firmware (CFW) for retro gaming for multiple devices/platforms.
- It is a fork of the Batocera firmware.
- There is now a port for the Anbernic.
- It provides a better experience than the stock firmware.

## Some Basics

### The SD Card

- The SD card has two partitions: `root` and `share`. We will only concern ourselves with the `share` partition.
- On `share` partitiion are the folders for adding content to the device.
- The `share/bios/` folder is the place where to add BIOS files (see below).
- The `share/roms/` folder contains folders for the different emulators for your games. Most of the folder names are self-explanatory.

### BIOS Files

- Some Emulators need BIOS files to run.
- Check for missing/needed BIOS files via: \
`Main Menu > Game Settings > Missing Bios Check`.
- Or select `All` to see all possibly needed ROM files.
- (Or [see all needed ROMS](https://github.com/batocera-linux/batocera.linux/blob/master/package/batocera/core/batocera-scripts/scripts/batocera-systems) here.)
- Find them online...
- ...and copy them into your SD card's `bios/` folder.
- To check if they are correct: \
`Main Menu > Game Settings > Missing Bios Check`

### ROM Files

- Find them online...
- Copy your files in the different `share/roms/` folders.
- Put your game's files in the correct emulator folders.
- Check the `_ìnfo.txt` files in each `roms/` subfolder for information on file format and folder structure to set things up.
- I've included a list of specific game port folders below.

### Controls

- [Batocera > Controller](https://wiki.batocera.org/supported_controllers)

#### General Navigation

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `POWER` | Long press to turn on. When turned on, click for standby. |
| `START` | Menu |
| `F + VOLUME` | Change brightness |
| `B` | OK / Select |
| `A` | Cancel / Back |
| `F + POWER` | Quick Shutdown (not saving metadata) |
| `R3 / L3` | Next / Previous Song (Frontend Music) |

- `A`+ `B` button assignment can be switched: \
`Main Menu > System Settings > Frontend Developer Options > Switch Confirm & Cancel Buttons in EmulationStation`. I recommend doing so.
- Shutdown the device: `Main Menu > Quit > Shutdown System > Yes` or press `F + POWER`.

- See [Batocera > Controls Overview](https://wiki.batocera.org/basic_commands).

#### Main Menu

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `START` | Quick Access |
| `L1 / L2` | Previous emulator |
| `R1 / R2` | Next emulator |
| `Y` | Quick Search |
| `B` | Side Menu |

#### Game List

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `SELECT` | View Options |
| `L1 / R1` | Page list up / down |
| `L2 / R2` | Previous / next emulator |
| `X` (long press) | Add / remove to Favorites |
| `A` (long press) | Edit meta data / Edit keyboard config |

#### In-game (GB, GBA, GB Color, NES, SNES, Sega, PSX)

- In games `A`and `B` are often switched.

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `F + START` | Exit Game |
| `F + RIGHT` | Fast Forward |
| `F + L1` | Take Screenshot |
| `F + UP / DOWN` | Select Quick Save Slot |

**Note**: To see the screenshots you took in the menu, run `Main Menu > Games Settings > Update Game List`. Then, you will have a "Screenshots" section in your main menu.

#### Quick Load / Save

- In most emulators, pressing `F + Y` or `F + X` will save or load a game's state.
- There is a list of slots you can save games, too. You select the slot via `F + UP / DOWN`.
- But you can also load a saved state when you are in the game list.
- In the game list, press `X` to show the saved state list.
- Press `A` to load a state, `Y`to delete one, and `B` to cancel.

## Setting Up The Device

Follow these steps to set up Knulli on your device. I arranged the steps in a helpful order, so it is best to follow them along.

- I recommend using two SD cards – one for Knulli and one for the ROMs and your Knulli settings. This has the advantage of updating Knulli without messing up your settings or games.
- The left slot will contain the Knulli card, and the right will contain the game ROMs.
- Use at least a 32GB card for Knulli.

### Installing Knulli on your device

- Download Knulli for your device from the [releases page](https://github.com/knulli-cfw/distribution/releases).
- Flash the firmware to a (new!) SD card (e.g., use [BalenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/)).
- Put the SD card in the device (left slot).
- Turn on the device (`Long-press on Power Button`).
- The device will now update the file structure on the SD card.

### Preparing the ROM SD card

- You need to format your second SD card (for the game ROMS) with the Linux **ext4** file format [to be able to run certain ports](https://knulli.org/guides/portmaster-and-exfat/#stick-with-ext4).
- Put the SD card in the right slot.
- Select the new card: `System Settings > Storage Device`.

- Consider setting up WiFi (see below).
- Reboot the device (`Menu > Quit > Restart System`).

### Setting up WiFi

- `Main Menu > Network Settings`.
- `Main Menu > System Settings > Frontend Developer Options > Enable web API access`.
- Now, you can find your device in your network.
- IP Address: `Main Menu > Network Settings`.
- **Note**: You can also define [multiple known WiFis](#setup-multiple-wifis).

#### WiFi Good!

- Now, you are able to download themes and enable scraping and other tools that need an Internet connection.
- In addition, you can now find your device on your network.
- You can **mount** the device to copy data, **connect via SSH** or the **Emulation Station Web Service**: \
 `http://[ip address]:1234`.
- Username and password are: `root/linux`.

**Note**: The device has problems to connect to 5GHz and guest networks.

### Download Themes

- A recommended theme is `Art-Book-Next-ES`: \
`Main Menu > Updates & Downloads > Themes > Art-Book-Next-ES`
- Enable your theme: \
`Main Menu > User Interface Settings > Theme Set`

### Enable Scraping

- A scraper can download game information to your device.
- You do need an active internet connection for this.
- Register an account at [screenscraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/).
- Enter your credentials at `Main Menu > Scraper`.

### Enable Retro Achievements

- Get a login at [retroachievements.org](https://retroachievements.org).
- Enter your credentials: `Main Menu > Game Settings > RetroArchievements Settings`.

### Update the ROM List on Each Boot

- `Main Menu > Games Settings > Netplay Settings > Index New Games`

## Additional Settings & Tipps

### Hide UI Help

- `Menu > User Interface Settings > On-Screen Help: OFF`

### Overclock

- `Main Menu > System Settings > Overclock`
- Pick what works for you.

### Audio Settings

- You can disable the in-menu music in `Main Menu > Sound Settings > Frontend Music`.

- Consider disabling `Enable Navigation Sounds`and `Enable Video Preview Audio`there, too.
- If you get no sound after you connect the console via HDMI, you need to reset the audio output:
  - Go to: `Main Menu > System Settings > Audio Output`.
  - Select `AudioCodec` and confirm. And then go back to `Auto`.

### Enable / Disable Analog Stick LEDs

- To enable/disable the LED lights: `System Settings > Services > analog_stick_LED`
- Under `Tools` you can configure the LEDs.

### Setup multiple WiFis

- Open and edit the file `share/system/batocera.conf`.
- Search for:

``` sh
# ------------ B - Network ------------ #
```

- There you can define multiple wifis, like this:

``` sh
## Wi-Fi SSID (string)
wifi.ssid=[some id]
## Wi-Fi KEY (string)
## Escape your special chars (# ; $) with a backslash. eg. $ becomes \$
wifi.key=[the password]]

## Secondary Wi-Fi (not configurable via the user interface)
wifi2.ssid=[some other wifi]]
wifi2.key=[the password]]
```

- These WifFs are then automatically recognized and connected to.

### Bluetooth

To connect a bluetooth device, follow these steps:

- Go to `Main Menu > Controller & Bluetooth settings > Pain Bluetooth Pads Automatically`.
- Alternatively, run a manual detection and select your device.
- Enable pairing mode on your device.
- You will get a notification when the device is paired to the console.

#### Connecting a Bluetooth Controller

- Follow the steps above.
- Turn on Bluetooth mode on your controller (e.g., `Y + START` on an *8bitdo* Controller).
- Enable pairing mode on your controller.
- Run the `Controller Mapping`.
- Adjust the `Player Assignments` to use the controller, e.g.:
  - `P1 > Controller`
  - `P2 > #0 Deeplay-Keys`

#### Using Bluetooth Audio

- Connect the audio device as described above.
- Select the Bluetooth audio device as audio output: \
  `Main Menu > System Settings > Hardware > Audio Output > [Device]`

#### Connecting other Bluetooth Devices

You can also pair keyboards and mice as described above.

### Mapping Keys to Pad Buttons For a Single Game

- In general, you can define global key settings for a system go to (here Amstrad):
`Game Setting > Per System Advanced Configuration > Amstrad CPC > Edit PadToKey Profile`
- But you can define keys per game as well.
- To see the current configuration, `SELECT > View Pad to Keyboard Information.`
- To edit it: `A (long press) > Edit PadToKey Profile`.
- This will create a configuration file in your `roms/` folder, either a `.p2k.cfg`or a `.keys` file.

#### Key File Format

- In general it's easier to use the UI to define keys, as described below,
- `.p2k.cfg` files have a [config style format](https://wiki.recalbox.com/en/advanced-usage/pad-to-keyboard).
  
``` cfg
  0:select = j ;; Joystick
```

- `.keys` files are in [JSON files](https://wiki.batocera.org/remapping_controls_per_emulator).

``` json
  {
      "actions_player1": [
          {
              "trigger": "select",
              "type": "key",
              "target": "KEY_J",
              "description": "Joystick"
          }
      ]
  }
```

- The `.keys` file precedes the `.k2p.cfg` one.
- You can also manually create a key config file in the folder. Use the name of the ROM/port and append the suffix.
- You can then add descriptions to the key definitions.  For both examples above, add "Joystick" as a description.
- In the `.k2p.cfg` files the buttons are `EAST`, `WEST`. In the `.keys` they are called `A`, `Y`.
- In the `.key` files, `L1` and `R1` are called `page up` and `page down`.
- The comments you enter in the key definition files will be displayed in the Key Definition UI.

## Workflow for Adding Content

- Copy files on the SD card (either from your computer or via WiFi).
- Remove Apple's dotfiles, if needed (see below).
- Eject all mounted partitions.
- Put card in RG35XX-H.
- Power on the device.
- Run the Scraper \
`Main Menu > Scraper > Scrape Now`
- Update the Game List \
`Main Menu > Games Settings > Update Game List`
- Play!!

**Note**: Alternatively, you can connect to your device via your network and mount the `share/` folder if it is connected via WiFi. Copy your filed, update the game list, scrape, and update again.

### Removing Apple's Dot Files

- On a Mac, you can run `dot_clean /Volumes/SHARE`.
- I also suggest to create a [dotclean](#dotclean) script in your `ports` folder.

## Setup and Optimizing Emulators

This section explains the "non-trivial" emulators (e.g. how *DOS* or *Daphne* are being set up).

### Playstation Portable (WiP) - PPSSPP

#### Loading Cheats

- Cheats will not only allow you to "cheat" in the game (duh). 
- There are also patches that allow you to increase the game's performance (fixed FPS cheats).
- Download the PPSSPP cheats pack \
`Menu > Updates & Downloads > Content Downloader > Playstation Portable > Cheats for PPSSPP emulator` 
- Enable Cheats per default \
`Game Settings > Per System Configuration > PlayStation Portable > Game Cheats: ON`

#### Use Cheats in Game

*TBD*

#### Increasing Performance *(WiP)*

- The RGXX devices can be a little overwhelmed by high-end Playstation and PSP games. Here are setting that will get the games running more smoothly.
- Use the `PPSSPPP`emulator, as it offers all performance options and allows you to enable cheats.
- Press `F`to open the internal settings

- `Quick Menu > Core Options > Hacks`
  - `(Skip Buffer Effects = ON)`
  - `Skip GPU Readback = ON`
  - `Lazy Texture Caching = ON`
  - `Spline Bezier Quality = LOW`
  - `Lower resolution for effects: Balanced` (may cause bugs) OR `Safe` (less likely to cause bugs)

- `Quick Menu > Core Options > Video`
  - `Rendering Resolution = 1x`
  - `Frameskip = 1`
  - `Frameskip Type = Number of Frames`
  - `Auto Frameskip = ON`
  - `Hardware Transform = ON`
  - `(Software Skinning = ON)`
  - `Texture Upscale Type  = xBRZ`
  - `Texture Deposterize = ON`
  - `Anisometric Filtering OFF`
  - `Texture Filtering Auto`

- `Skip Buffer Effects` could result that the game is not rendered.

### Amstrad

- The emulator used is [Caprice32](https://docs.libretro.com/library/caprice32/).
- Fire and movement will automatically recognized as joystick input.
- Therefore, **don't map keyboard navigation** to the joysticks or the D-PAD keys.
- Bind the virtual keyboard (`F9` for Caprice32) to `the right analog stick click` for all of Amstrad, in case you need other keys. \
  `Game Setting > Per System Advanced Configuration > Amstrad CPC > Edit PadToKey Profile > Right Stick Press = F9`
- For a game only assign the keys to select and start a game (e.g., joystick or single-player mode). \
  When a game is selected: `A (long press) > Create/Edit PadToKey Profile`
- **Note**: Amstrad's *return* key does not equal the `Enter` key. I have not found a way to map this to it.

### Nintendo DS

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `R2` | Toggle Display View Mode |
| `L2 + R2` | Toggle Single Double View Msode |

### Nintendo 64

- You need to change the default emulator to make games run smoothly.
- Go to `Game Settings > Per System Advanced Configuration > Nintendo 64`.
  - Set `Emulator: Mupen64Plus:RICE`.
  - Set `Power Mode: High Performance`.
  - Set `Game Aspect Ration: 4:3`.
- I have not yet found a way to access the hotkey menu or to _Quick Load_ or _Quick Save_.

|Button|Function|
|-|-|
| `F + START` | Exit Game |
| `F + RIGHT` | Fast Forward |
| `F + A` | Reset Game |
| `F + L1` | Take Screenshot |

- To switch the `A` and `B` buttons, edit the `system\configs\mupen64\input.xml` file:

``` xml
  <input name="b" value="C Button R" />
  <input name="a"  value="A Button" />
```

### MS-DOS

- There are different DOS emulators that you can choose. Per default, `DOSBox Pure` is used.
- Copy a game folder to `roms/dos/`.
- Add `.DOS` to the end of the folder name.
- If there is a `dosbox.conf` file in the game folder, its settings will be applied.
- If there is a `dosbox.bat` file in the game folder, it will be executed.
- If you start the game without a `dosbox.bat` file, you will get the start menu where you can select a file as the default executable. Use the right joystick and the `Y`key to select a file. You can also select a timeout, where the first X frames after starting a game are not shown.
- After selecting an executable, it will be run, and a file called `AUTOBOOT.DBP` will be created.
- A keyboard overlay will be shown if you press `L3`.
On the top left of the overlay keyboard, there is an option to map keys manually. However, it is preferable to use the Batocera key mapping.

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `L3` | Show Keyboard (and Keyboard Mapper button) |
| `LEFT JOYSTICK` | Mouse |
| `F + UP /DOWN` | Load / Save |
| `F + RIGHT` | Fast Forward |
| `Y` | OK |

## Configuring Ports & Portmaster

- In addition to preinstalled ports there is *Portmaster* preinstalled on Knulli.
- *Portmaster* is a program that that allows you to install and manage “game ports”—that is, Linux-native versions or open-source re-implementations of classic and modern games.
- Often you need to copy the original game files into the folder of installed ports.

- **Note**: If your ROM SD card is not `ext4` formatted, [some ports might not run](https://knulli.org/guides/portmaster-and-exfat/#stick-with-ext4).
- **Note**: Always start by reading the `_info.txt` file in the emulator's folder.

Here are some popular ports that run on the RGXX device (see how-tos below):

### Stardew Valley

#### Prerequisites

- You bought Stardew Valley on Steam.
- you installed the Stardew Valley port via Portmaster on your handheld.

#### Select the right game sources from Steam

- To download the game, you need its app ID (here [413150](https://steamdb.info/app/413150/)) and the depot ID (= OS, here Linux and [413513](https://steamdb.info/depot/413153/)), and then select the correct manifest (= version). On the [manifest page](https://steamdb.info/depot/413153/manifests/), filter by compatibility.
- If you want a specific version, compare the manifest date with the [version history](https://steamdb.info/app/413150/patchnotes/). If not, use the most recent one (the one on the top).

#### Download the game sources

- The easiest way to download the game is to use [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader/releases/tag/DepotDownloader_3.0.0). 
- Download the latest version for your OS.
- In the [SteamDB manifest list](https://steamdb.info/depot/413153/manifests/), click the copy button next to "your" release. You will get something like this in your clipboard: \
  `-app 413150 -depot 413153 -manifest 8332166493523218127 -beta compatibility` \
  (`8332166493523218127` refers to version 1.6.15.)
- Use these parameters and include the -user parameter: \
  `DepotDownloader -app 413150 -depot 413153 -manifest 8332166493523218127 -beta compatibility -user`
- You will have to enter your Steam password to download the files. DepotDownload will download your files in a folder structure like this: \
  `depots/413153/16826373`

#### Copy files to your handheld / SD card

- Copy the content of the bottom-most directory to your SD card to this folder: \
  `share/roms/ports/stardewvalley/gamedata/`
- Done! Now, Stardew Valley should run fine.

(And yes, it takes about 30 seconds for it to start. Don't worry.)

**Note**: If you want to update your Stardew Valley to a new version, follow all steps and re-install Stardew Valley via Portmaster on your device. \
**Note**: You can also copy [savegames](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Saves) from your computer onto your handheld and vice versa. \
**Note**: I recommend scaling the _UI_ and the _Zoom level_ a bit – I use 110% (set it in the Stardew Valley Options).

### Balatro

Works as described [here](https://portmaster.games/detail.html?name=balatro). Install via Portmaster and copy a single file.

### Diablo 1 & Diablo Hellfire - Devilutionx

- Copy `DIABDAT.MPQ` from the CD or Diablo installation to `roms/devilutionx/` folder.
- To run the Diablo: Hellfire expansion, you will need also to copy `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `B` | OK / Select, Use Skill |
| `A` | Cancel / Back, Use Weapon |
| `X` | Pick up item |
| `Y` | Use Spell |
| `Left D-Pad` | Movement |
| `Right D-Pad` | Mouse |
| `START` (pressed) | In-Game Menu |
| `START` (pressed) | Spells |
| `START + F` | Show items |
| `L1` | Use Health Potion |
| `R1` | Use Mana Potion |
| `L2` | Character |
| `R2` | Inventory |
| `R2` | Toggle Map |

- You cannot edit the `Advanced System Options` key definitions.
- You can edit the key definitions in the Game: `Settings > Pad mappig`.  There, `A` and `B`, and `X` and `Y` are reversed.
- There is also a Playstation version of Diablo. The controls are nicer, but the graphics are more "blocky." It runs a bit less smoothly.

#### Links

- [Batocera > DevilutionX](https://wiki.batocera.org/systems:devilutionx)

### Duke Nukem 3D - eDuke32

- Create folder called `duke` in `roms/eduke32/` and copy `DUKE3D.GRP` into it.
- Create file `Duke_Nukem_3D.eduke32` in `roms/eduke32/`.
- Add line `FILE = /duke/DUKE3D.GRP` to it.

| Button | Function |
|-|-|
| `B` | OK / Select |
| `A` | Cancel / Back |
| `R2` | Fire |
| `X` | Kick |

### Fallout 1 - fallout1-ce

- Copy the following files from your Fallout game into the `rom/dallout1-ce` folder:
  - `master.dat`
  - `critter.dat`
  - `data/` folder
- Create an empty file called `Fallout.f1ce`.

- Initially, only the right joystick works in the game.

- Therefore, you need to define your keys: \
  Go to the Fallout entry in the Ports section `A (long press) > Edit PadToKey Profile`

- Create a folder for each game and copy files into it.
- Inside the folder, create a file called `[id].scummvm` for each game you want to add. To be sure, also write and put the ID into the file.
- **Note:** _Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis_ uses the id `indy4` and not `atlantis`
The [supported games list](https://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php?title=Category:Supported_Games) shows the required files for a game.

#### ScummVM Resolution Settings
  
- Per default, the games are not scaling to the Anbernic screen. Here are my settings to fix this. Go to `Game Settings > Per System Advanced Settings > ScummVM`
  ```
  Scale Factor: 3x
  Scaler Mode: ADVMAME
  Stretch Mode: Fit Resolution Scale
  ```
